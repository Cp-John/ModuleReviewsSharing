# ModuleReviewsSharing

Inspired by the module reviews sharing web application of Peking University (url: https://courses.pinzhixiaoyuan.com/), we aim to build a professional module reviews sharing application of NUS with the core features: 
1. search (with refinements); 
2. review and ratings posting; 
3. anonymouse forum under each module; 
4. my module list; 
5. admin account
6. more to explore ...

## Running the project

1. run 'npm run build'(only at the first run and after new modifications)
2. run 'node server.js' to start the project (Navigate to 'http://localhost:3000/' to load the home page)
